**Title:** Test & Validate: Complete MV3 Migration Testing

**URL:** https://github.com/ziyaaktas/tab-limiter/issues/5

**Labels:** enhancement

**Project:** tab-limiter (moved to "Todo" status)

---

## Summary

Comprehensive testing and validation of the Chrome Extension Manifest V3 migration to ensure all functionality works correctly before Chrome Web Store submission.

**Key Testing Areas:**
- Service worker lifecycle behavior (idle/wake cycles, state persistence)
- Tab limiting functionality (total limits, window limits, pinned tab handling)
- Options page and storage persistence
- Edge cases (batch tab creation, multiple windows, session restore)
- Performance benchmarks

## Motivation

The MV3 migration introduces significant architectural changes, particularly the shift from persistent background pages to event-driven service workers. These changes can introduce subtle bugs around:
- State loss when service worker terminates
- Race conditions during rapid tab creation
- Session restore handling after browser restart

## Test Cases

Includes comprehensive test cases for:
- **A. Basic Functionality** - Extension loading, options save/load
- **B. Tab Limiting** - Total limits, window limits, pinned tab handling
- **C. Service Worker Lifecycle** - Idle recovery, browser restart, session restore
- **D. Edge Cases** - Batch creation, multiple windows, incognito, performance
- **E. UI Tests** - Badge display, alert messages, options page
- **F. Error Handling** - Storage errors, input validation
- **G. Console Verification** - No errors or deprecated API warnings

## Acceptance Criteria

- All test cases in sections A-G pass
- Performance benchmarks met
- No regression from MV2 behavior
- Extension ready for Chrome Web Store submission
