**Title:** Handle Service Worker Lifecycle: State Persistence and Event Registration

**Status:** Created and moved to "Todo" in the tab-limiter project

The issue covers:
- Using `chrome.storage.session` for transient state persistence across service worker restarts
- Synchronous top-level event listener registration pattern
- `runtime.onInstalled` and `runtime.onStartup` lifecycle handlers
- State reconstruction from storage on every event
- Badge persistence on wake-up
- Complete code structure template
- Testing scenarios for lifecycle, session restore, badge persistence, and DevTools termination
- Links to related issues #1 and #2
