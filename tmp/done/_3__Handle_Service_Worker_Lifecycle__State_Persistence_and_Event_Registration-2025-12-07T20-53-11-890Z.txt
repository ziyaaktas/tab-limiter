Issue #3 has been implemented and closed. The implementation includes:

**Changes Made:**
1. **SessionState module** - Replaced standalone functions with a cohesive module using `chrome.storage.session` for persisting transient state across service worker restarts
2. **`chrome.runtime.onStartup` handler** - Initializes session state when browser launches
3. **`handleInstalled` enhancement** - Distinguishes between install (sets default options) and update (logs version) scenarios
4. **`refreshBadge` function** - Standalone function for badge updates on service worker wake-up
5. **All state operations** - Now use `SessionState.get()`, `SessionState.set()`, `SessionState.incrementPasses()`, and `SessionState.decrementPasses()` instead of in-memory variables

**Key Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- `chrome.storage.session` used for all transient state
- All event listeners registered synchronously at top level
- `chrome.runtime.onInstalled` handles first install and updates
- `chrome.runtime.onStartup` initializes session state on browser launch
- No global variables used for state
- Badge updates correctly after service worker wake-up

The GitHub issue has been closed. The project status update could not be completed due to a network connectivity issue with GitHub's GraphQL API, but the issue is closed and the implementation is committed.
