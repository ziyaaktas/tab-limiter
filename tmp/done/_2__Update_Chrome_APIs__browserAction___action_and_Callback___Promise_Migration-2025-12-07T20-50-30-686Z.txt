Task complete. The implementation for GitHub Issue #2 has been completed with the following changes:

**Summary of Changes:**

1. **background.js** - Fully migrated to async/await:
   - `getOptions()` - converted from nested callbacks to async/await
   - `tabQuery()` - converted from Promise wrapper with callback to async function
   - `windowRemaining()` / `totalRemaining()` - converted from Promise chains to async/await
   - `updateBadge()` - already used async/await, added try/catch
   - `updateTabCount()` - added try/catch error handling
   - `detectTooManyTabsInWindow()` / `detectTooManyTabsInTotal()` - converted from Promise wrappers to async functions with explicit return values
   - `handleExceedTabs()` - converted to async with try/catch
   - All event handlers wrapped with try/catch error handling

2. **options.js** - Complete rewrite:
   - Removed browser compatibility shim (`const browser = chrome || browser`)
   - Replaced `chrome.browserAction` with `chrome.action` API
   - `saveOptions()` - converted from callback to async/await
   - `restoreOptions()` - converted from nested callbacks to async/await
   - `getOptions()` - added as async helper function
   - `updateBadge()` - converted to async/await with try/catch
   - All tab query utilities converted to async/await
   - Removed obsolete message display code
