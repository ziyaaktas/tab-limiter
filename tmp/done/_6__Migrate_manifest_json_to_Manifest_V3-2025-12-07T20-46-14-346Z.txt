Issue #6 is complete. The manifest.json has been migrated to Manifest V3 with all acceptance criteria met:

- `manifest_version` set to `3`
- `browser_action` renamed to `action`
- Background scripts converted to `service_worker` format
- `tabs` permission added
- Version bumped to `0.4.0`
- Author updated to Ziya Aktas
- JSON validated as syntactically correct

The issue has been moved to "Done" status in the project board. Note that as mentioned in the issue, the extension will need issues #1 and #2 completed before it functions at runtime, since the background.js still uses MV2 API patterns.
