# Privacy Policy for Tab Limiter Deluxe

**Last Updated:** December 9, 2025

## Overview

Tab Limiter Deluxe is a browser extension that helps users manage their browser tabs by enforcing configurable limits. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles data.

## Data Collection

**Tab Limiter Deluxe does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.**

The extension operates entirely within your browser and does not communicate with any external servers, APIs, or third-party services.

## Data Storage

The extension stores the following data locally on your device:

### User Preferences (Synced via Chrome)
- Maximum total tab limit
- Maximum tabs per window limit
- Alert display preferences
- Badge display preferences
- Custom alert message text
- Pinned tab counting preference

These settings are stored using Chrome's built-in sync storage, which may sync across your devices if you are signed into Chrome. This sync is handled entirely by Google Chrome and is subject to Google's privacy policy.

### Session Data (Temporary)
- Current tab count
- Session-specific counters for tab management

This temporary data is stored only for the duration of your browser session and is automatically cleared when Chrome is closed.

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **Storage:** To save your preferences and session state locally

- **Notifications:** To display alerts when tab limits are exceeded

These permissions are used solely for the core functionality of the extension and not for data collection.
